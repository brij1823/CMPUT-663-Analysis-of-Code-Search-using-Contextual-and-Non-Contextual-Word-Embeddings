# CMPUT-663-Analysis-of-Code-Search-using-Contextual-and-Non-Contextual-Word-Embeddings

Millions of repetitive code snippets are submitted to code repositories every day. To search from these large codebases using simple natural language queries would allow programmers to prototype faster. This ability to search the code using natural language is called Code Search. Recent works in this area have majorly focused on analysing the quality of the code embedding models. In this work, we also analyse the efficiency  of these embedding models by comparing a contextual and non contextual word embeddings on which the code embedding models are formed.
